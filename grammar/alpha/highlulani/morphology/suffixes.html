<h1>Suffixes
</h1><br>[4]Derivational Suffixes
<br>There are many derivational suffixes which change a word from one part of speech to another.
<br>[5]Patientive
<br>These transform a verb into a noun (animate, inanimate or abstract), which played a non-subjective part in the original verb.
<br>For instance <strong>bumaki</strong> <em>screen</em> could mean <em>drawing</em> (object), <em>recipient of the message</em> (animate dative), <em>message</em> (complement object), et cetera. However, not all of these are necessarily accepted.
