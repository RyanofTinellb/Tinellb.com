<h1>Suprasegmentals
</h1><br>[4]Syllabication
<br>Syllable breaks are placed between two geminate consonants.
<br>If there are no geminates, then the final vowel, and every second vowel going backwards are their own syllables. 
<br>[4]Prosody
<br>Interrogative and imperative sentences (questions and orders) are denoted by tone. This tone is either a rising tone (&#x1ce) or a falling tone (&acirc;), placed on the syllable of the appropriate word which has the greatest stress.
<br>Falling tone can also be used to bring focus to a particular word.
