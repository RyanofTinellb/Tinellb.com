<h1>Suprasegmentals</h1>
<h2>Syllabication</h2>
<p>Syllable breaks are placed between two geminate consonants.</p>
<p>If there are no geminates, then the final vowel, and every second vowel going backwards are their own syllables. </p>
<h2>Prosody</h2>
<p>Interrogative and imperative sentences (questions and orders) are denoted by tone. This tone is either a rising tone (&#x1ce) or a falling tone (&acirc;), placed on the syllable of the appropriate word which has the greatest stress.</p>
<p>Falling tone can also be used to bring focus to a particular word.</p>
