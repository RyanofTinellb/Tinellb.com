<h1>Internal History</h1>
<p>Within the universe named Tinellb, there is a planet named Ptoko. There arose on this world a race of humanoids, the Ptokan. Over millions of years, their race evolved and became the dominant force on their planet.</p>
<p>There had been many conflicts, small and large, throughout their history. One particularly bloody war had had much of the population brought into it: a World War. The survivors of this war were ruled by a single monarch.</p>
<p>Generations passed. The people rebuilt their shattered world. The newest ruler, Queen Loren, decided to create an international language to promote peace amongst her subjects. She named this language Lulani after herself.</p>
<p>Despite their shared language, as more time went by, fractures again showed between nations. Another world war ensued. A great weapon was created, one that tore apart space-time, flinging its victims far out into the universe.</p>
<p>One such group were the Fezhl&ecirc;. They found themselves on a world already inhabited by the Zhaladi. The Fezhl&ecirc; tongue evolved independently from Lulani, and was influenced by Zhaladi dialects.</p>
<p>The people that remained on Ptoko slowly grew back towards peace. Their vernacular evolved into Ptokan, and thence into Tsarin. By the time of Tsarin, Lulani was used only for science and the arts, not for everyday use.</p>
