[1]Introduction
The Tinellbian languages are a range of constructed languages, as befits the constructed universe of Tinellb. In that world, the ancestor language was created by Queen Loren of the Ptokonoi, and then evolved naturally as different groups of people moved through space, time and reality.
[2]History
The internal history of the Guozu and their languages is written as if it were a chronicle of actual events. The external history is the more prosaic record: a description of the genesis and evolution of my ideas.
[3]Internal History
Within the universe named Tinellb, there is a planet named Ptoko. There arose on this world a race of humanoids, the Ptokan. Over millions of years, their race evolved and became the dominant force on their planet.
There had been many conflicts, small and large, throughout their history. One particularly bloody war had had much of the population brought into it: a World War. The survivors of this war were ruled by a single monarch.
Generations passed. The people rebuilt their shattered world. The newest ruler, Queen Loren, decided to create an international language to promote peace amongst her subjects. She named this language Lulani after herself.
Despite their shared language, as more time went by, fractures again showed between nations. Another world war ensued. A great weapon was created, one that tore apart space-time, flinging its victims far out into the universe.
One such group were the Fezhl&ecirc;. They found themselves on a world already inhabited by the Zhaladi. The Fezhl&ecirc; tongue evolved independently from Lulani, and was influenced by Zhaladi dialects.
The people that remained on Ptoko slowly grew back towards peace. Their vernacular evolved into Ptokan, and thence into Tsarin. By the time of Tsarin, Lulani was used only for science and the arts, not for everyday use.
Tsarin was spoken in the realm of Tsarein.

[3]External History
I have been interested in language and linguistics since at least the age of 10. I remember making up words when I was quite young. In fact, the High Lulani word <strong>mica</strong> <em>hello</em> dates from that time.
When I decided to write a novel, a constructed language (conlang) was an obvious prospect for inclusion in the background information. I had the beginnings of what was to be the Ptokan language, and the language of the Fezhl&ecirc;. The latter  was once designed as a daughter language of Ptokan, but it had some features, mostly phonological, that seemed to come from an earlier language. Thus was Lulani born. Originally intended to be a phonology sketch, Lulani has expanded greatly into a language in its own right. So much so, in fact, that Ptokan and Fezhl&ecirc; have been forced to change somewhat to adapt.
[1]High Lulani
High Lulani is the language created by Loren, queen of the Ptokonoi. It features a semi-closed verb class and extensive compounding. It has a featural script.
[2]Phonology
High Lulani phonology has 18 consonant sounds and 3 vowels. Plosives are the only class that have a voicing distinction; fricatives are prototypically voiceless, and resonants are prototypically voiced. Vowels are defined in terms of openness and frontness; there are no oral, length or tone distinctions. All High Lulani words are formed from alternating consonant-vowel pairs. Any word-internal consonant can be geminated.
[3]Consonants
Consonants are differentiated by manner and place of articulation, and by word-internal gemination. Plosives also have contrasting voice.
[t] | labial | alveolar | palatal | velar | glottal
[r]stop | p b | t d | c &#x25f; &lt;j&gt; | k g | &#x294; &lt;&rsquo;&gt;
[r]nasal | m | n |  | &#x14b; &lt;q&gt;
[r]lateral |  | l
[r]central |  | &#x279; &lt;r&gt;
[r]fricative | f | s | &#x255; &lt;x&gt; |  | h
[/t]
This table shows the consonants phonemically, using the International Phonetic Alphabet. Where it differs from IPA, the transliteration is given in &lt;triangular brackets&gt;. Capital or geminate glottal stops are transliterated with &lt;&#x294;&gt;.
[4]Stops
Plosives are differentiated by voicing, although voiced consonants tend to be rarer than their voiceless counterparts.
The voiced plosives are fully voiced word-internally and partially voiced word-initially. Voiced geminate plosives are given breathy voice. Voiceless plosives are lightly aspirated, which is suppressed in voiceless geminate plosives.
Geminate plosives are held for approximately twice as long as non-geminate plosives.
[5]Labials
The plosives /p/ and /b/ are bilabial.
[f]<strong>pu&rsquo;iba</strong> <em>ball</em>
[e]<strong>qapi</strong> <em>rope</em>
[e]<strong>kuppu</strong> <em>be strong</em>
[e]<strong>bufi</strong> <em>pebble</em>
[e]<strong>huba</strong> <em>to breathe</em>
[e]<strong>sabba</strong> <em>father</em>
[5]Alveolars
The plosives /t/ and /d/ are apical.
[f]<strong>turassi</strong> <em>redhead</em>
[e]<strong>fi&rsquo;atu</strong> <em>certain</em>
[e]<strong>matta</strong> <em>again</em>
[e]<strong>daru</strong> <em>road</em>
[e]<strong>xidu</strong> <em>far away</em>
[e]<strong>kuddu</strong> <em>rain</em>
[5]Palatal
The plosives /c/ and /&#x25f;/ are laminal. In fast speech, they can approach the affricates /t&#x283;/ and /d&#x292;/.
[f]<strong>cissa</strong> <em>air</em>
[e]<strong>xuci</strong> <em>feather</em>
[e]<strong>nacca</strong> <em>clothing</em>
[e]<strong>jagaru</strong> <em>sand</em>
[e]<strong>sajimu</strong> <em>crack</em>
[e]<strong>majja</strong> <em>here</em>
[5]Velars
The velar plosives are /k/ and /g/.
[f]<strong>ka&rsquo;u</strong> <em>jump</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;isaki</strong> <em>cooperate</em>
[e]<strong>nukki</strong> <em>strawberry</em>
[e]<strong>gurrisu</strong> <em>door</em>
[e]<strong>danagi</strong> <em>decree</em>
[e]<strong>saggi</strong> <em>iron pyrites</em>
[5]Glottal
The glottal stop is one of the most common sounds. Non-geminate glottal stops are often suppressed between unstressed vowels. The second of a geminate glottal stop becomes a palatal approximant /j/.
[f]<strong>&rsquo;anu</strong> balance
[e]<strong>kuli&rsquo;a</strong> friend
[e]<strong>nasi&#x294;u</strong> sheep
[4]Nasals
There are nasal consonants at each of the places of articulation of the plosives. However, the palatal nasal is only found when geminating the alveolar nasal. Nasals are prototypically voiced. Geminate nasals are held for 1 &frac12; times as long as non-geminates.

[5]Labial
The labial nasal /m/ is bilabial.
[f]<strong>mana</strong> <em>bubble</em>
[e]<strong>salumi</strong> <em>seven</em>
[e]<strong>lupumma</strong> <em>fire</em>
[5]Alveolar
The alveolar nasal /n/ is apical. When geminated, this sound is palatal and laminal.
[f]<strong>nu</strong> <em>to</em> <em>stop</em>
[e]<strong>lulani</strong> <em>queen</em>
[e]<strong>sinna</strong> <em>story</em>
[5]Velar
The nasal /&#x14b;/ is velar.
[f]<strong>quliru</strong> <em>family</em>
[e]<strong>kunaqi</strong> <em>earth</em>
[e]<strong>laqqu</strong> <em>wealth</em>
[4]Approximants
The approximants are mainly differentiated by laterality. This language lacks phonemic glides. Like nasals, approximants are prototypically voiced, and geminates are held for 1 &frac12; times as long as non-geminates.
The consonant /l/ is lateral and apical. When geminated, this sound is laminal and palatal.
The consonant /&#x279;/ is central and laminal. When geminated, this sound becomes a trill.
[f]<strong>lassi</strong> baby
[e]<strong>kulu</strong> fork
[e]<strong>malliju</strong> happiness
[e]<strong>ru&rsquo;iha</strong> history
[e]<strong>karafi</strong> enlightenment
[e]<strong>qarri</strong> to open
[4]Fricatives
<strong>Fricatives</strong> do not have complete closure of the vocal tract, but are formed with enough constriction to bring turbulence to the airstream.
Fricatives are prototypically voiceless. The lips remain unrounded for all fricatives unless followed or preceded by a rounded vowel. Geminate fricatives are held for 1 &frac12; times as long as non-geminates.
[5]Labial
The fricative /f/ is realised as labiodental.
[f]<strong>faxi</strong> to survive
[e]<strong>bufiqi</strong> illness
[e]<strong>kilaffi</strong> three
[5]Alveolar
The fricative /s/ is apical.
[f]<strong>sikka</strong> <em>skin</em>
[e]<strong>husabi</strong> <em>finger</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;alissa</strong> <em>to</em> <em>need</em>
[5]Palatal
The palatal fricative /&#x255;/ is laminal.
[f]<strong>xaha</strong> <em>name</em>
[e]<strong>puxila</strong> <em>message</em>
[e]<strong>dixxa to</strong> <em>drink</em>
[5]Glottal
The fricative /h/ is a voiceless sound. When geminate, it is pronounced as a palatal fricative.
[f]<strong>hannaku</strong> <em>cat</em>
[e]<strong>tihu</strong> <em>to dwell</em>
[e]<strong>quhha</strong> <em>river</em>
[3]Vowels
There are three phonemic vowels, with three main allophones for each. The vowels are distinguished by closeness and frontness.
[t] | front | central | back
[r]close | i | (&#x268;) (&#x289;) | u
[r]mid |  | (&#x259;)
[r]open | a
[/t]
There are three phonemic vowels: two close vowels and one open. These are given in the above chart, with the variant allophones in (round brackets). The central and mid vowels are considered the lax variants, while the lengthened vowels are long.
[4]Front
The front close vowel is unrounded. It is realised as /i/ or /&#x268;/.
[f]<strong>mici</strong> <em>peace</em>
[e]<strong>dinaku</strong> <em>mirror</em>
[e]<strong>lu&rsquo;i</strong> <em>love</em>
[4]Open
The open vowel is unrounded. It can be realised as /a/ or /&#x259;/.
[f]<strong>kanama</strong> <em>to play</em>
[e]<strong>naru</strong> <em>slowly</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong> <em>table</em>
[4]Back
The back close vowel is rounded. It can be realised as /u/ or /&#x289;/.
[f]<strong>mulu</strong> <em>blood</em>
[e]<strong>bunali</strong> <em>rhyme</em>
[e]<strong>riccu</strong> <em>sphere</em>

[3]Phonotactics
Phonemically, all syllables are CV, that is, one consonant followed by one vowel. Word-internal consonants can be geminated. The only consonant clusters are geminate consonants, and there are no vowel clusters or long vowels.
[3]Suprasegmentals
[4]Syllabication
Syllable breaks are placed between two geminate consonants.
If there are no geminates, then the final vowel, and every second vowel going backwards are their own syllables. 
[4]Stress
In a stem word, primary stress falls on the last closed syllable, and secondary stress on the penultimate closed syllable.
[4]Prosody
Interrogative and imperative sentences (questions and orders) are denoted by tone. This tone is either a rising tone (&#x1ce) or a falling tone (&acirc;), placed on the syllable of the appropriate word which has the greatest stress.
Falling tone can also be used to bring focus to a particular word.
[2]Orthography
[3]Syllabary
The Lulani syllabary was developed as a featural script, with similar sounds having similar symbols.
It is written in horizontal rows, right-to-left, and top-to-bottom.
[t] | stop | voiced | nasal | lateral | central | fricative
[r]labial | <high-lulani>pPo</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>bBO</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>mMU</high-lulani> |  |  | <high-lulani>fFv</high-lulani>
[r]alveolar | <high-lulani>tTe</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>dDE</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>nNI</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>lLW</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>rRw</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>sSz</high-lulani>
[r]palatal | <high-lulani>cCy</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>jJY</high-lulani> |  |  |  | <high-lulani>xXZ</high-lulani>
[r]velar | <high-lulani>kK&gt;</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>gG&lt;</high-lulani> | <high-lulani>qQA</high-lulani>
[r]glottal | <high-lulani>aiu</high-lulani> |  |  |  |  | <high-lulani>hHV</high-lulani>
[/t]
Geminate consonants are shown as <high-lulani>;</high-lulani>, placed before the geminated consonant.
A central dot <high-lulani>/</high-lulani> is placed between words, and sentences begin and end with a <high-lulani>.</high-lulani> symbol.
While their shapes have been modified over time, it is still fairly clear how each phonetic feature has been symbolised.
[l]stop: (none)
nasal: vertical stroke
fricative: arc
lateral: swish
central: loop
labial: low circle
alveolar: apex
palatal: corner
velar: semi-circle
glottal: high circle
open vowel: (none)
front vowel: vertical line
back vowel: horizonal line
[/l]
[2]Morphology
High Lulani is an analytic agglutinative language, as morphemes tend to keep their own shape, even when forming words.
[3]Nouns
Common and proper nouns are open classes; the pronouns are closed.
[4]Proper Nouns
Proper nouns begin with a capital letter in the transliteration.
[f]<strong>Ra&rsquo;ani</strong> <em>Ryan</em> (name of a person)
[e]<strong>&#x294;ikinnisa</strong> <em>Eakins</em> (name of a family)
[e]<strong>Sa&rsquo;imi</strong> <em>Caemi</em> (name of a deity)
[e]<strong>Tinalli</strong> <em>Tinellb</em> (name of a universe)
[e]<strong>&#x294;irri&rsquo;a</strong> <em>Ir&igrave;a</em> (name of a city)
[e]<strong>Lulani</strong> <em>Lulani</em> (name of a language)
[e]<strong>Xucinagi Cula</strong> <em>The Crackled Egg</em> (name of a story)
[4]Common Nouns
Common nouns can refer to abstract or concrete items.
[f]<strong>lu&rsquo;i</strong> <em>love</em>
[e]<strong>bata</strong> <em>caution</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;ahati</strong> <em>happiness</em>
[e]<strong>caga</strong> <em>mouth</em>
[e]<strong>purissiji</strong> <em>circle</em>
[5]Gender
There are very few words with specific gender, mostly those dealing with family, as well as <strong>lulani</strong> <em>queen</em> and <strong>kimilli</strong> <em>king.</em> In these cases, the feminine form is the default, for people of undefined, unknown or non-binary gender.
[5]Compound Nouns
The first part of a compound noun must be a noun, and the subsequent parts specify the meaning of that noun. These parts can be nouns or verbs. The whole noun is usually written without spaces. The syllabification and stress of nonce words are determined on a stem-by-stem basis. However, a compound in common use will start being treated whole.
[f]<strong>jifiru&rsquo;inulli</strong> <em>mountain lake</em> ( <strong>jifiru&rsquo;i</strong> <em>lake</em> + <strong>nulli</strong> <em>mountain</em> ) 
[e]<strong>xu&rsquo;abaju</strong> <em>bluebird</em> (  <strong>xu&rsquo;a</strong> <em>bird</em> + <strong>baju</strong> <em>blue</em> )
[4]Pronouns
Pronouns are a closed class.
[5]Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns are marked for case and person. Third person pronouns are marked for animacy.
[t]

2nd person
3rd person animate

[/t]
<strong>Case</strong> will be discussed in a later section.
[6]Person
<strong>First person</strong> refers to the speaker or speakers, and any group for whom they are speaking.
<strong>Second person</strong> refers to the listener or listeners, and any group the listener is representing.
<strong>Third person</strong> refers to any other party. It is not used for the subject of the sentence, whether present or implied.
[6]Number
Pronouns are not marked for number. However, if the pronoun refers to a group that includes more than one of these persons, then additional pronouns can be constructed as follows:
[l]The second person transitive pronoun <strong>fu</strong> can be suffixed to the first person pronouns to form first person inclusive plural pronouns.
The third person intransitive inanimate pronoun <strong>pa</strong> can be suffixed to any first or second person pronouns, including those with <strong>fu</strong>, to form other plural pronouns.
[/l]
[f]<strong>sumafu</strong> <em>you and I</em>
[e]<strong>pixifu</strong> <em>to you and me</em>
[e]<strong>puttupa</strong> <em>from them and me</em>
[e]<strong>fillipa</strong> <em>they and you</em>
[e]<strong>pagufupa</strong> <em>of you, them and me</em>
[6]Animacy
<strong>Animate</strong> pronouns refer to people and other multicellular organisms capable of independent movement.
<strong>Inanimate</strong> pronouns refer to anything else, such as natural phenomena, plants, fungi, unicellular life and abstract concepts.
[5]The Genitive
The genitive is used to mark a connection between nouns, including one noun possessing another.
[6]Alienable Possession
Possession is <strong>alienable</strong> when the possessed item can be transferred from one owner to another. Alienable possessions include objects bought or received by a person.
The structure of the possessive phrase for alienable possession is possessor <strong>genitive</strong> possessed. The genitive marker marks the animacy of the possessor.
[f]<strong>julliga disi kulu</strong> <em>the married woman, her fork</em>
[e]<strong>manafa qa jifiru&rsquo;i</strong> <em>the country, its lake</em>
[e]<strong>pagu xissata</strong> <em>my musical instrument</em>
[e]<strong>disi nukki</strong> <em>his strawberry</em>
[6]Inalienable Possession
<strong>Inalienable</strong> possession refers to items which are unable to be transferred from one individual to another. Inalienable possessions include relatives, parts of the body and objects created by a person.
For inalienable possession, as well as genitive constructions that do not involve literal possession, the structure is possessed-<strong>genitive</strong> possessor, that is, the genitive marker is an enclitic on the possessed item. This marker is always the third person inanimate genitive pronoun, unless the possessor is a plain pronoun. 
[f]<strong>kahipagu</strong> <em>my arm</em>
[e]<strong>sabbaqa lulani</strong> <em>the queen&rsquo;s father</em>
[e]<strong>hafiqa nasi&#x294;u</strong> <em>the sheep field</em>
[e]<strong>Ra&rsquo;aniqa &#x294;ikinisa</strong> <em>Ryan (of the family) Eakins</em>
[e]<strong>Sa&rsquo;imiqa Tinalli</strong> <em>Caemi from Tinellb</em>
[6]Contrasts
Because of the nature of alienability, some contrasts can be made between possessives.
[f]<strong>luffupagu</strong> <em>my eyes, the ones with which I was born</em>
[e]<strong>pagu luffu</strong> <em>the eyes I just bought and have in my hand</em>
[f]<strong>&rsquo;asilariba</strong> <em>your friend</em>
[e]<strong>ba &rsquo;asilari</strong> <em>the friend you own</em>
[f]<strong>hu&rsquo;asadisi</strong> <em>the painting she made</em>
[e]<strong>disi hu&rsquo;asa</strong> <em>the painting she bought</em>
Alienable possession is used in a hierarchy when the possessor is of higher rank than the possessed, and inalienable possession when the relationship is the other way around.
[f]<strong>lulanipagu</strong> <em>my queen</em>
[e]<strong>pagu</strong> <strong>mifasu</strong> <em>my vassal</em>
[5]Indefinite Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns are not marked for animacy.
[t]
object
place
manner
state
[r]proximate
mari
majja
madusi
marika
[r]distal

[/t]
[l]The pronouns in the <strong>object</strong> column are used for people and things.
The <strong>place</strong> column pronouns are used for locations in both space and time.
The <strong>manner</strong> column is used to refer to the way in which an action is undertaken, and
The <strong>state</strong> column refers to the condition of a thing.
<strong>Objects</strong> and <strong>places</strong> are used as <strong>nouns</strong>, <strong>manners</strong> and <strong>states</strong> are used as adverbs.
<strong>Proximate</strong> pronouns refer to objects and places physically or psychologically near the speaker, whereas
<strong>Distal</strong> pronouns are used when the referent is far away.
<strong>Interrogative</strong> pronouns are used in questions, and
<strong>Negative</strong> pronouns are used in negative sentences.
<strong>Universal</strong> means &ldquo;all&rdquo; or &ldquo;every&rdquo;,
<strong>Existential</strong> means &ldquo;some&rdquo; or &ldquo;any&rdquo;.
[/l]
The &lsquo;object&rsquo; indefinite pronouns can modify a noun when used as a suffix. When <strong>cu&rsquo;i</strong> <em>nothing</em> is used as a suffix, it loses its last syllable. When <strong>&rsquo;umi</strong> <em>something</em> is used as a suffix, it loses its first syllable.
[f]<strong>takacu</strong> <em>no sound</em>
[e]<strong>manafamari</strong> <em>this country</em>
[e]<strong>lulanimi</strong> <em>some queen</em>
[e]<strong>kulu&rsquo;aba</strong> <em>every fork</em>
[e]<strong>nullisama</strong> <em>which mountain?</em>
[e]<strong>&#x294;usu&rsquo;aba filli&rsquo;abata</strong> <em>every me and every you</em>
The existential markers are used in complements. For instance &ldquo;I learned what her name is.&rdquo;
The dative marker is not applied to distal pronouns.
Reduplicated indefinite pronouns with suffixed <strong>-ta</strong> <em>and</em> are used for emphasis.
[f]<strong>sama samata</strong> <em>what the hell?</em>
[e]<strong>cu&rsquo;i cu&rsquo;ita</strong> <em>nothing and no one</em>
[e]<strong>qa&rsquo;i qa&rsquo;ita</strong> <em>never ever</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;aba &rsquo;abata</strong> <em>absolutely everything</em>
[4]Attributives
There is a special class of verbs that allow one noun to modify another in a particular way. They are suffixes for the modifying noun. This whole word is then placed before the noun being modified. The modified noun can be proper, common or a pronoun.

In order to make any of these negative, add the adjective <strong>ji&rsquo;a</strong> <em>not</em> to the second noun.

[3]Verbs
A verb is a necessary part of any sentence, except for <strong>copular</strong> sentences (q.v.).
[4]Basic Verbs
The class of basic verbs is <strong>semi-closed</strong>. Basic verbs consist of one stem.
[f]<strong>&rsquo;i</strong> <em>to say</em>
[e]<strong>dissu</strong> <em>to feel</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;usa</strong> <em>to see</em>
[e]<strong>janni</strong> <em>to move</em>
[e]<strong>kissa</strong> <em>to fight</em>
[e]<strong>miku</strong> <em>to make red</em>
[4]Compound Verbs
In order to extend or specify the meaning of many verbs, verbs can be compounded much as a noun can. Compound verbs are, however, much more common than compound nouns, to make up for the relative lack of basic verbs.
[f]<strong>&rsquo;isinna</strong> <em>to tell a story</em> (<strong>&rsquo;i</strong> <em>to speak</em> + <strong>sinna</strong> <em>story</em>)
[e]<strong>dissu&rsquo;ahati</strong> <em>to be happy</em> (<strong>dissu</strong> <em>to feel</em> + <strong>&rsquo;ahati</strong> <em>happiness</em>)
[e]<strong>pamilami</strong> <em>to be conscious</em> (<strong>pa</strong> <em>think</em> + <strong>milami</strong> <em>surroundings</em>)
Monosyllabic verbs may only be used this way. The object of an transitive monosyllabic verb can be used to form the compound, however, this does not occur with polysyllabic verbs.
[f]<strong>dissu &rsquo;ahati</strong> <em>to feel happiness</em> (as above)
[e]<strong>gasunu</strong> <em>to put the cloak (somewhere)</em> (<strong>ga</strong> <em>to put</em> + <strong>sunu</strong> <em>cloak</em>)
[e]*<strong>ga sunu</strong>
[e]*<strong>jannisunu</strong>
[e]<strong>janni sunu</strong> <em>to move the cloak</em> (<strong>janni</strong> <em>move</em>)

[4]Transitivity
Verbs are broken down into one of a number of types:
<strong>Transitive</strong> verbs require an object.
<strong>Intransitive</strong> verbs do not require an object.
Ambitransitive verbs can be used transitively or intransitively.
The transitivity of a compound verb is the same as that of the base verb.
[3]Auxiliaries
<strong>Auxiliaries</strong> are a type of helper verb, however, they are sufficiently different from main verbs for them to be treated separately in this grammar. They are used to mark <strong>tense</strong> (the time at which an action takes place) and <strong>aspect</strong> (the nature of the passage of time during the action). The auxiliary can be dropped from a sentence if it is obvious from context, or is the same as that of the sentence immediately prior. They are a closed class.
They were originally intended to be main verbs, so some of these may seem familiar (cf: attributives).

[4]Tense
The three tenses are <strong>past</strong>, <strong>present</strong> and <strong>future</strong>. In conversation, the tenses tend to mark the time at which the action began or occurred.
On the other hand, narratives are mainly told in present tense. The other tenses are then used relatively, so that past tense is used for things that happened earlier than the narrative present, and the future tense for things that happened later.
[4]Aspect
There are five aspects. For simplicity, &lsquo;negative&rsquo; is considered an aspect in this grammar.
[5]Dynamic
 The <strong>dynamic</strong> aspect is used for changes of state, and actions that occupy one moment in time. The exception is verbs of perception, where the action may be taking place over a period of time.
[f]<strong>cani kiluqu</strong> to take a step (<strong>cani</strong> present dynamic ; <strong>kiluqu</strong> to walk)
[e]<strong>cani miku</strong> to turn red (<strong>miku</strong> to be red)
[e]<strong>cani &rsquo;usa</strong> to see (it) (<strong>&rsquo;usa</strong> to see)
[5]Stative
The <strong>stative</strong> aspect is used for temporary states and attributes, or for continual actions taking place over a period of time. The exception again is verbs of perception, where the stative aspect denotes <strong>potentiality</strong>, that is, the ability to perceive the stimulus.
[f]<strong>ra&rsquo;u kiluqu</strong> to be walking (<strong>ra&rsquo;u</strong> present stative)
[e]<strong>ra&rsquo;u miku</strong> to be red
[e]<strong>ra&rsquo;u &rsquo;usa</strong> to be able to see (it)
[5]Negative
The <strong>negative</strong> aspect is used for actions, attributes and perceptions which do not occur. These act as the negation of any other aspectual marker. That is, while positive sentences can be classified by aspect, negative sentences all use the same auxiliaries.
[f]<strong>ji kiluqu</strong> to not take a step / to not be walking (<strong>ji</strong> present negative)
[e]<strong>ji miku</strong> to not turn red / to not be red
[e]<strong>ji &rsquo;usa</strong> to not see (it) / to not be able to see (it)
[5]Iterative
The <strong>iterative</strong> aspect is used for actions that take place at discrete intervals.
[f]<strong>na kiluqu</strong> to habitually walk (<strong>na</strong> present iterative)
[e]<strong>na miku</strong> to be red at intervals
[e]<strong>na &rsquo;usa</strong> to see (it) often
[5]Gnomic
The <strong>gnomic</strong> aspect is used for states and attributes that are always true or are intimately associated with the subject.
[f]<strong>ru kiluqu</strong> to be always walking (<strong>ru</strong> present gnomic)
[e]<strong>ru miku</strong> to be (always) red
[e]<strong>ru &rsquo;usa</strong> to be continuously looking at (it)
Verbs of perception being used intransitively can also occur with gnomic auxiliaries, to signify an ongoing ability to use a particular sense.
[f]<strong>ru &rsquo;usa</strong> to be able to see
[3]Adverbs
<strong>Adverbs</strong> are a closed class. Adverbs can be used either as a verbal suffix or independently to describe the entire utterance.
[f]<strong>naru</strong> <em>slowly</em>
[e]<strong>dura</strong> <em>repeatedly</em>
[e]<strong>kupira</strong> <em>intensely</em> 
[4]Modals
A subclass of adverb are the <strong>modals</strong>, words used to denote properties of sentences, such as their reality, probability or the speaker&rsquo;s emotions towards the topic. These may only be used independently.
[f]<strong>matta</strong> <em>again</em>
[e]<strong>tasi</strong> <em>probably</em>
[e]<strong>nufira</strong> <em>hopefully</em>
[3]Suffixes
[4]Derivational Suffixes
There are many derivational suffixes which change a word from one part of speech to another.
[5]Patientive
These transform a verb into a noun (animate, inanimate or abstract), which played a non-subjective part in the original verb.
For instance <strong>bumaki</strong> <em>screen</em> could mean <em>drawing</em> (object), <em>recipient of the message</em> (animate dative), <em>message</em> (complement object), et cetera. However, not all of these are necessarily accepted.
[3]Adpositions
<strong>Adpositions</strong> are a closed class.
[f]<strong>di</strong> <em>up</em>
[e]<strong>haru</strong> <em>with</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;adi</strong> <em>close</em>
[e]<strong>gibi</strong> <em>east</em>
These can be used in three different ways.
[4]Preposition
The most basic use for an adposition is prefixed to a noun to signify where the action is taking place with relation to a reference.
[f]<strong>di&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong> atop the table (<strong>di</strong> up ; <strong>&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong> table
[e]<strong>harululani</strong> with the queen (<strong>haru</strong> with ; <strong>lulani</strong> queen)
[e]<strong>nicula</strong> in an egg (<strong>ni</strong> at ; <strong>cula</strong> egg)
[e]<strong>qakalu&rsquo;ita&rsquo;i</strong> <em>down from the cart</em> (<strong>qa</strong> <em>down</em> ; <strong>kalu</strong> <em>from</em> ; <strong>&rsquo;ita&rsquo;i</strong> <em>cart</em>)
[4]Nomninal and Verbal Modifier
Adpositions can also be used in conjunction with nouns and verbs to make compounds.
[f]<strong>jannigibi</strong> <em>to go east</em> (<strong>janni</strong> <em>to move</em> ; <strong>gibi</strong> <em>east</em>
[e]<strong>gusu&rsquo;adi</strong> <em>nearby people</em>
[4]Adverb
Adpositions can be used by themselves to show the position of the action relative to the speaker, or the direction in which the action proceeds. Unlike other adverbs, these are placed after the auxiliary.
[f]<strong>&rsquo;adi</strong> nearby
[e]<strong>qa hussu</strong> drop down (<strong>qa</strong> down ; <strong>hussu</strong> drop)
[3]Adjectives
There is a closed class of true <strong>adjectives</strong>, words used to give qualities of a noun.
[f]<strong>mimu&rsquo;i</strong> <em>some</em>
[e]<strong>fi&rsquo;atu</strong> <em>certain</em>
[e]<strong>sabufi</strong> <em>different</em>
These can only be used as noun suffixes.
[3]Particles
There are very few particles. These are simply words that do not fit neatly into any other category.
[f]<strong>li</strong> <em>complementiser</em>
[e]<strong>xiku</strong> <em>relativiser</em>
[e]<strong>piba</strong> <em>superlative</em>
[3]Conjunctions
<strong>Conjunctions</strong> are a closed class of words which are used to join phrases or clauses together.
[4]Phrase-level Conjunctions
These conjunctions are used to join words or phrases. They are enclitics.
[f]<strong>ta</strong> <em>and</em>
[e]<strong>sija</strong> <em>or</em>
[4]Clause-level Conjunctions
These conjunctions are used to join clauses or sentences. They are used as independent words.
[5]Coordinating Conjunctions
<strong>Coordinating conjunctions</strong> are used to separate two matrix clauses. They are placed at the beginning of the second clause.
[f]<strong>qu</strong> <em>and</em>
[e]<strong>nuki</strong> <em>or</em>
[5]Subordinating Conjunctions
<strong>Subordinating conjunctions</strong> are used to introduce a dependent clause.
[f]<strong>surra</strong> <em>when</em>
[e]<strong>daru&rsquo;i</strong> <em>because</em>

[2]Syntax
High Lulani is head-initial in compounds, but tends to be head-final in phrases and clauses. The language has Subject-Verb-Object order, but shows signs of an SOV nature, as dative and ablative complements become more common.
[3]Case
[4]Alignment
The three basic arguments for any verb (intransitive subjects, transitive subjects and transitive objects) are marked in High Lulani. Because intransitive subjects cannot co-occur with transitive arguments, it is possible to mark either of the transitive arguments in the same way as the intransitive without confusion. In the <strong>ergative</strong> alignment, it is the transitive object that is marked the same as the intransitive subject. In <strong>accusative</strong> alignment, it is instead the transitive subject that shares marking with intransitive subjects. In either alignment, the <strong>intransitive</strong> case is the one treated like the intransitive subject, and the <strong>transitive</strong> case is the other.
High Lulani has an ergativity split, made down aspectual lines. A clause using dynamic or iterative auxiliaries uses ergative alignment; gnomic, stative and negative aspects attract the accusative.
[4]Core Cases
The core cases mark the basic arguments of the verb. Common or proper nouns have no case markings for these, but the pronouns have different forms. Therefore only pronouns show the alignment of a sentence.
[5]Intransitive
The <strong>intransitive</strong> case is used for the sole argument of an intransitive verb and for the unmarked argument of transitive sentences. This case is also used for adpositions.
[5]Transitive
The <strong>transitive</strong> case is used for the marked argument of transitive sentences, that is, the object in an accusative clause, and the subject in ergative clauses.
[4]Oblique Cases
The two oblique cases are marked on the pronouns. For common and proper nouns, a clitic with the same form as the appropriate third person inanimate pronoun is placed before the noun phrase.
Sometimes the verb requires an oblique rather than a traditional object. In these cases, the subject is usually in intransitive case, although it is not incorrect to use transitive case with dynamic and iterative auxiliaries.
[5]Ablative
The <strong>ablative</strong> case is used to mark the proximate cause or the instigator of an action. With verbs of transfer or motion, it is also used to mark the source of a movement. The clitic is <strong>kalu</strong>.
[f]<strong>sacu</strong> because of you / from you
[e]<strong>kaluTinallibi janni</strong> come from Tinellb (<strong>janni</strong> to move)
[e]<strong>kalukimilli kuffa</strong> given by the king (<strong>kimilli</strong> king ; <strong>kuffa</strong> to give)
[5]Dative
The <strong>dative</strong> case was originally only used to mark the receiver with verbs of giving and transfer. The meaning has since broadened to show indirectness on the part of the patient for a number of verbs, including verbs of perception and emotion. The clitic is <strong>ku-</strong>.
[f]<strong>pixi</strong> to me
[e]<strong>jusi &rsquo;usa</strong> to see him (<strong>jusi</strong> to him ; <strong>&rsquo;usa</strong> <em>see</em>)
[e]<strong>ku&#x294;irri&rsquo;a janni</strong> go to Ir&igrave;a (<strong>janni</strong> <em>to move</em>)
[e]<strong>kululani kuffa</strong> give to the queen (<strong>lulani</strong> queen ; <strong>kuffa</strong> to give) 
[3]Matrix Clauses
The standard word order for matrix clauses is:
Subject &dash; Auxiliary &dash; Adposition - Oblique &dash; Verb &dash; Object &dash; Adverb.
None of these slots are compulsorily filled. If a subject is obvious from context, or is the same as that of the immediately prior sentence, it can be dropped. The adverb can act as a pro-sentence.
[4]Intransitive Clauses
As already discussed, intransitive clauses do not have objects.
[f]<strong>Mihu ra&rsquo;u nara</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3int</small-caps> <small-caps>prs;sta</small-caps> <em>sleep</em>
[e]&ldquo;He is asleep.&rdquo;
[4]Transitive Clauses
Transitive clauses do require an object.
[f]<strong>&#x294;usu ru lu&rsquo;i fu</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>1int</small-caps> <small-caps>prs;gno</small-caps> <em>love 2</em><small-caps>tra</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
Sometimes the object is in an oblique case.
[f]<strong>Mihu ra&rsquo;u kuqikanni &rsquo;usa</strong>
[e]<small-caps>3ani;int</small-caps> <small-caps>prs;sta</small-caps> <small-caps>dat</small-caps><em>-dog see.</em>
[e]&ldquo;She can see the dog.&rdquo;
[4]Copular Sentences
<strong>Copular sentences</strong> do not have a main verb. These sentences are used to show an equivalence relationship between two nouns, or to show that one noun is an element of the set described by the other noun. They are transitive sentences.
[f]<strong>Mihu labu julliga</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani;int</small-caps> <small-caps>fut;dyn</small-caps> <em>married_woman</em>
[e]&ldquo;She will become a married woman.&rdquo;
Another use of copular sentences is to tell the location of something in relation to something else.
[f]<strong>Pa ra&rsquo;u di&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ina;int</small-caps> <small-caps>prs;gno</small-caps> <em>down-table</em>
[e]&ldquo;It&rsquo;s under the table.&rdquo;
The copular sentence structure for ownership is as follows. It has the possessor in the dative case, and the possessum as the subject.
[f]<strong>Sunu ru pixi</strong>.
[e]<em>Cloak</em> <small-caps>prs;gno 1dat</small-caps>
[e]I have a cloak.
The arguments may be swapped without a change in meaning.
[f]<strong>Pixi ru sunu.</strong>
[e]<em><small-caps>1dat prs;gno</small-caps> cloak.</em>
[e]I have a cloak.
[4]Contrasting Pronouns
These example sentences have been given to clarify alignment and the correct use of pronouns with different auxiliaries.
[f]<strong>Mihu qixa miku</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani.int pst;dyn</small-caps> <em>red</em>
[e]&ldquo;She turned red.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Mihu pi miku</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani.int pst;sta</small-caps> <em>red</em>
[e]&ldquo;She was red.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Quhu qixa dasi pa</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani.tra pst;dyn</small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps> 3ina.int</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;She ate it.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Mihu pi dasi &rsquo;iffa</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani.int pst;sta</small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps> 3ina.tra</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;She was eating it.&rdquo;
As can be seen, the only time the transitive case is used for the subject of a clause is in transitive (as well as copular) sentences using dynamic or iterative auxiliaries.
[3]Deixis
[4]Possessive Markers
An item possessed by the third-person subject of a matrix clause need not appear with a genitive marker, whether the possession is alienable or inalienable.
[f]<strong>Sabba &rsquo;usa tu.</strong>
[e]<em>Father see daughter.</em>
[e]&ldquo;Dad saw his daughter.&rdquo;
If a genitive marker does appear, it takes the form <strong>su&rsquo;a</strong> <em>own</em>.
[f]<strong>Sabba &rsquo;usa tusu&rsquo;a.</strong>
[e]<em>Father saw daughter-own.</em>
[e]&ldquo;Dad spoke to his daughter.&rdquo;
The usual genitive markers refer to possession by some other party, not the subject.
[f]<strong>Sabba  tu li dasi raninidisi labu hiqa.</strong>
[e]<em>Father offspring <small-caps>com</small-caps> eat potato-<small-caps>dim-3ani;gen fut;dyn</small-caps> order.</em>
[e]&ldquo;Dad asked his daughter to eat her chips.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Sabba tu li dasi raninisu&rsquo;a labu hiqa.</strong>
[e]<em>Father offspring <small-caps>com</small-caps> eat potato-<small-caps>dim</small-caps>-own <small-caps>fut;dyn</small-caps> order.</em>
[e]&ldquo;Dad asked my daughter to eat his chips.&rdquo;
None of the above applies for first- and second-person subjects; these use their normal genitive markers.
[3]Argument Promotion
The first noun in a clause is the subject, which is prototypically the agent in transitive sentences and the patient in intransitive sentences. However, suffixes can be added to the verb to promote other nouns in the clause, other than the genitive.
There are three such verbal suffixes, which can be stacked, however, once something has been shifted from the subject position, it can&rsquo;t be promoted again.
[4]Passive
The suffix <strong>illu</strong> promotes the object. This suffix replaces the final vowel of the verb. The old subject is then marked with the ablative case. A sentence with this marker is intransitive. The demoted item is not compulsory, but if it is put in, it is the first ablative-marked noun in the new sentence.
[f]<strong>Fu qixa kissaji kilatu&rsquo;i!</strong>
[e]<small-caps>2tra pst;dyn</small-caps> <em>fight</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>deer</em>
[e]&ldquo;You fought a deer!&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Kilatu&rsquo;i qixa (sacu) kissajillu</strong>.
[e]<em>deer</em><small-caps> pst;dyn (2abl)</small-caps> <em>fight</em><small-caps>-psv</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;A deer was fought (by you).&rdquo;
[4]Ablative
The suffix <strong>pakka</strong> <small-caps>abp</small-caps> promotes an ablative. The old subject is demoted to object, and the old object is demoted to dative. A sentence with this marker is transitive. The first dative-marked noun in the new sentence is the demoted item.
[f]<strong>Lulani qixa kalukimilli dasi qasa</strong>.
[e]<em>queen</em><small-caps> pst;dyn abl-</small-caps><em>king</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>fish</em>
[e]&ldquo;The queen ate a fish because of the king.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Kimilli qixa kuqasa dasipakka lulani</strong>.
[e]<em>king</em><small-caps> pst;dyn dat-</small-caps><em>fish</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps>-abp</small-caps> <em>queen</em><small-caps>.</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;The king made the queen eat fish.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Kimilli qixa (kalululani) dasillupakka qasa</strong>.
[e]<em>king</em><small-caps> pst;dyn (abl-</small-caps><em>queen</em><small-caps>)</small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps>-psv-abp</small-caps> <em>fish</em>
[e]&ldquo;The king made the fish get eaten (by the queen).&rdquo;
[4]Dative
The suffix <strong>xa</strong> promotes a dative. The old subject is demoted to object, and the old object (if any) is demoted to dative. A sentence with this marker is transitive.
[f]<strong>Mulisa ru kuquxi kuffa laqqu</strong>.
[e]<em>fool</em><small-caps> prs;gno dat-</small-caps><em>mountain</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>give</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>money</em>
[e]&ldquo;A fool gives money to the mountain.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Quxi ru kulaqqu kuffaxa mulisa</strong>.
[e]<em>mountain</em><small-caps> prs;gno dat-</small-caps><em>money</em><small-caps> give-dtv</small-caps> <em>fool</em>
[e]&ldquo;It is to the mountain that fools give money.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Quxi ru (kalumulisa) kuffilluxa laqqu</strong>.
[e]<em>mountain</em><small-caps> prs;gno (abl-</small-caps><em>fool</em><small-caps>)</small-caps> <em>give</em><small-caps>-psv-dtv</small-caps> <em>money</em>
[e]&ldquo;It is to the mountain that money is given (by fools).&rdquo;
[4]Adposition
To promote a adpositional phrase to subject, prefix the verb with the adposition. The old subject is demoted to object. The old object, if any, is demoted to dative.
[f]<strong>Mihu pi nijagaru gupi</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani;int pst;sta at-</small-caps><em>sand</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>sit</em>
[e]&ldquo;She sat in the sand.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Jagaru pi nigupi quhu</strong>.
[e]<em>sand</em><small-caps> pst;sta at-</small-caps><em>sit</em><small-caps> 3ani.tra</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;It was the sand that she sat in.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Mihu pi nijagaru dasi nukki</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>3ani;int pst;sta at-</small-caps><em>sand</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>eat</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>strawberry</em>
[e]&ldquo;He was eating a strawberry in the sand.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Jagaru pi kunukki nidasi quhu</strong>.
[e]<em>sand</em><small-caps> pst;sta dat-</small-caps><em>strawberry</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>in-eat</em><small-caps> 3ani;tra</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;It was in the sand that he was eating the strawberry.&rdquo;
[3]Dependent Clauses
A <strong>dependent clause</strong> is a clause that is unable to stand meaningfully by itself.
They are marked by having the auxiliary at the end.
[4]Subordinate Clauses
A <strong>subordinate clause</strong> is one introduced by a subordinating conjunction in the matrix clause. A comma is used to separate a subordinate from its matrix. The conjunction is placed on the side of the main clause that is closest to the subordinate. The clauses can be put in either order.
[f]<strong>&#x294;usu ru lu&rsquo;i fu daru&rsquo;i, <u>ba pu&rsquo;iba miku ra&rsquo;u</u></strong>.
[e]<small-caps>1int prs;gno</small-caps> <em>love</em><small-caps> 2tra</small-caps> <em>because</em><small-caps>, 2gen</small-caps> <em>ball</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>red</em><small-caps> prs;sta</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;I love you because your ball is red.&rdquo;
[f]<strong><u>Ba pu&rsquo;iba miku ra&rsquo;u</u>, daru&rsquo;i &rsquo;usu ru lu&rsquo;i fu</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>2gen</small-caps> <em>ball</em><small-caps></small-caps> <em>red</em><small-caps> prs;sta,</small-caps> <em>because</em><small-caps> 1int prs;gno</small-caps> <em>love</em><small-caps> 2tra</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;I love you because your ball is red.&rdquo;
Here the subordinate clauses are underlined. The cause is subordinate to the effect.
[4]Adverbial Clauses
An adverbial clause is one which acts as an adverb.
[5]Location Adverbial Clauses
The word <strong>ma</strong> <em>where</em> is often used as a prefix for adpositions used as clausal conjunctions.
[f]<strong>&#x294;usu lu&rsquo;i fu madi, ba pu&rsquo;iba miku qixa</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>1int</small-caps> <em>love</em> <small-caps>2tra</small-caps> <em>where-up,</em> <small-caps>2gen</small-caps> <em>ball red</em> <small-caps>pst;dyn.</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;I loved you before your ball turned red.&rdquo;
[4]Content Clauses
A <strong>content clause</strong> is one that takes the place of a noun. They begin with the complementiser <strong>li</strong> and are separated from the matrix clause by commas. The auxiliary is not optional, and is given a low tone. Quote marks are used around reported speech, replacing the complementiser. 
[f]<strong>Li &rsquo;usu kissajijisuka kugibi&rsquo;Asi&rsquo;a rusa, qixa puttu pillu</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>1int</small-caps> <em>fight-ideology</em> <small-caps>dat</small-caps><em>-east-Asia</em> <small-caps>pst;gno</small-caps><em>,</em> <small-caps>pst;dyn</small-caps> <small-caps>1abl</small-caps> <em>think-</em><small-caps>psv</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;That we&rsquo;ve always been at war with Eastasia, is what I think.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Suma qixa kululani icipu, li quhu pixi kuffa dissudanagi qixa</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>1tra</small-caps> <small-caps>pst;dyn</small-caps> <small-caps>dat</small-caps><em>-queen speak-question,</em> <small-caps>com</small-caps> <small-caps>3ani;tra</small-caps> <small-caps>1dat</small-caps> <em>give new-decree</em> <small-caps>pst;dyn</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;I asked the queen if she had pardoned me.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Mihu qixa &rsquo;i, &ldquo;Filli mulisa ra&rsquo;u?&rdquo;</strong>
[e]<small-caps>3ani.int</small-caps> <small-caps>pst;dyn</small-caps> <em>speak &ldquo;</em><small-caps>2int</small-caps> <em>fool</em> <small-caps>prs;sta</small-caps><em>?&rdquo;</em>
[e]&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Are you a fool?&ldquo;
[4]Relative Clauses
<strong>Relative clauses</strong> specify the noun by describing it. They are placed before the modified noun, beginning with the relativiser <strong>xiku</strong>. The auxiliary is not optional, and is given a rising tone. Only subjects can be relativised. Other cases must be promoted to subject.
[f]<strong>Xiku lu&rsquo;i kimilli pi lulani</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>rel</small-caps> <em>love king</em> <small-caps>pst;sta</small-caps> <em>queen</em>
[e]&ldquo;The queen who loved the king.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Xiku kalukimilli lu&rsquo;illu pi lulani</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>rel</small-caps> <small-caps>abl</small-caps><em>-king love-</em><small-caps>psv</small-caps> <small-caps>pst;sta</small-caps> <em>queen</em>
[e]&ldquo;The queen whom the king loved.&rdquo;
Any noun can be modified by relative clauses, including pronouns and proper nouns.
[f]<strong>Xiku lu&rsquo;i kimilli pi mihu</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>rel</small-caps> <em>love king</em> <small-caps>pst;sta 3ani.int</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;The one who loved the king.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Xiku lu&rsquo;i kimilli pi Sa&rsquo;imi</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>rel</small-caps> <em>love king</em> <small-caps>pst;sta</small-caps> <em>Caemi</em>
[e]&ldquo;Caemi, who loved the king.&rdquo;
[5]Intransitives
If the only argument of the relative verb is the modified noun, the auxiliary is appended to the verb, and the relativiser is dropped. This auxiliary is not given any tone.
[f]<strong>kiluqupi kimilli</strong> the walking king
[e]<strong>dissu&rsquo;ahatira&rsquo;u mulisa</strong> the happy fool
[e]<strong>bibuna suma</strong> the occasionally complaining me
[e]<strong>ka&rsquo;ucani Ra&rsquo;ani</strong> the jumping Ryan
Similar are intransitives utilising the case markers and other adpositions.
[f]<strong>kalukimilli nuhu</strong> <em>the letter from the king</em>
[e]<strong>kululani nukki</strong> <em>the strawberry for the queen</em>
[e]<strong>di&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong> <strong>pa</strong> <em>the thing under the table</em>
[4]Questions and Requests
Questions and requests are main clauses, but have the same auxiliary movement as dependent clauses, and thus are treated alongside them here.
[5]Interrogatives
An <strong>interrogative</strong> is a question. There are two main types, polar questions and content questions.
<strong>Polar questions</strong> are one in which the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. They are spoken with a rising tone on the last word. The auxiliaries are used to answer.
[f]<strong>Lulani lu&rsquo;i suma r&acirc;&rsquo;u?</strong>
[e]<em>queen love</em> <small-caps>1tra prs;sta</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Does the queen love me?&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Ra&rsquo;u. / Ji. / Ruku. / Pi</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>prs;sta  prs;neg  fut;gno  pst;sta</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; / &ldquo;No.&rdquo; / &ldquo;She will.&rdquo; / &ldquo;She did.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Lulani nimalu j&icirc;?</strong>
[e]<em>queen bear</em> <small-caps>prs;neg</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Is the queen not a bear?&rdquo;
[e]<strong>Ji. / Ra&rsquo;u. / Na</strong>.
[e]<small-caps>prs;neg  prs;sta  prs;itr</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s not.&rdquo; / &ldquo;No, she is.&rdquo; / &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
If the focus of the question is on a particular noun, that noun receives a falling tone.
[f]<strong>Lul&#x1ce;ni lu&rsquo;i suma r&acirc;&rsquo;u?</strong>
[e]<em>queen love</em> <small-caps>1tra prs;sta?</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;The <em>queen</em> loves me?&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Lulani lu&rsquo;i s&#x1d4;ma r&acirc;&rsquo;u?</strong>
[e]<em>queen love</em> <small-caps>1tra prs;sta?</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;The queen loves <em>me</em>?&rdquo;
<strong>Content questions</strong> are ones in which the expected answer is more than just &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. These questions have a rising tone on the main question word itself.
[f]<strong>Lulani lu&rsquo;i s&acirc;ma ra&rsquo;u?</strong>
[e]<em>queen love what</em> <small-caps>prs;sta</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Whom does the queen love?&rdquo;
[f]<strong>Kimilli / Fu / Cu&rsquo;i</strong>
[e]<em>king</em> / <small-caps>2tra</small-caps> / <em>nothing</em>
[e]&ldquo;The king.&rdquo; / &ldquo;You.&rdquo; / &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
[6]Quantities
Lulani questions regarding quantity or measurement are phrased thus:
[f]<strong>Filli kikas&acirc;ma huba rusa?</strong>
[e]<small-caps>2int</small-caps> <em>interval-what breathe</em> <small-caps>pst;gno</small-caps><em>?</em>
[e]&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;

[5]Imperatives
An <strong>imperative</strong> statement is an order.
Second person imperatives are directed to the listener. In these, the subject is dropped, a future auxiliary in the appropriate aspect is suffixed to the verb, and this verb complex is moved to the end of the sentence. These are spoken with a falling tone on the auxiliary.
[f]<strong>Lulani lu&rsquo;ir&#x1d4;ku!</strong>
[e]<em>queen love-</em><small-caps>fut;gno</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;Love the queen!&rdquo;

[3]Noun Phrases
The full noun phrase is made up of these components in the following order:
[n]adposition-
case marker-
number
superlative
relative clause
attributive
main noun
-adjective
-conjunction
-genitive marker
[/n]
Hyphens in this list are used to mark where a space is not used to separate components.
Relative clauses include intransitives.
The only compulsory component of a noun phrase is the noun itself.
[f]<strong>faluki</strong> (vii) <em>journey</em>
[e]<strong>kululani</strong> (ii-vii) <em>to the queen</em>
[e]<strong>diku&rsquo;i&rsquo;uja</strong> (i-ii-vii) <em>onto the table</em>

[e]Eating meat offends some people.
[3]Comparatives
[4]Comparatives
The comparative marker is an adposition <strong>su</strong> <em>than</em> placed on the noun being compared against. For &ldquo;little more&rdquo;, the qualifier <strong>tuci</strong> <em>half-do</em> is affixed to the verb, for &ldquo;a lot more&rdquo;, the qualifier is <strong>rali</strong> <em>intensely</em>.
[4]Equalatives
The equalative marker is <strong>ka</strong> <em>as</em>, an adposition.
[4]Superlative
The superlative marker, contrary to the other two, is a particle placed before the verb.
[2]Apocrypha
This section details particular categories of vocabulary items.
[3]Numbers
[4]Cardinal Numbers
High Lulani numbers are written with the positive digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7), their negative counterparts (<overline>1</overline>, <overline>2</overline>, <overline>3</overline>, <overline>4</overline>, <overline>5</overline>, <overline>6</overline> and <overline>7</overline>) and a zero (0).
When writing out a number, each digit is worth fifteen times as much as the following digit. A period (fractional point: . ) is used to separate the integer part of the number from the mantissa. A comma (,) is used in the integer part to separate the digits into groupings of four, beginning from the fractional point.
[f]<strong>2</strong> <em>two</em>
[e]<strong>5.<overline>3</overline></strong> <em>four and four-fifths = five + (minus three &times; (fifteen ^ minus one))</em> 
[e]<strong>1<overline>7</overline></strong> <em>eight = (one &times; fifteen) + (minus seven)</em>
[e]<strong>20</strong> <em>thirty = (two &times; fifteen)</em>
[e]<strong>3<overline>2</overline>6</strong> <em>six hundred and forty-one = 
(three &times; (fifteen ^ two)) + (minus two &times; fifteen) + six</em>
[e]<strong><overline>1</overline>,34<overline>5</overline>3</strong> <em>minus thirty-nine thousand, six hundred and seventy-two =
(minus one &times; (fifteen ^ four)) + (three &times; (fifteen ^ three)) + 
(four &times; (fifteen ^ two)) + (minus five &times; fifteen) + three</em>
[5]One-digit Numbers
Here are the names for the one-digit numbers:
[f]<strong><overline>7</overline></strong> <em>haki</em>
[e]<strong><overline>6</overline></strong> <em>jusiti</em>
[e]<strong><overline>5</overline></strong> <em>laffi</em>
[e]<strong><overline>4</overline></strong> <em>missu</em>
[e]<strong><overline>3</overline></strong> <em>bila</em>
[e]<strong><overline>2</overline></strong> <em>kirallu</em>
[e]<strong><overline>1</overline></strong> <em>mullu</em>
[e]<strong>0</strong> <em>qikka</em>
[e]<strong>1</strong> <em>xita</em>
[e]<strong>2</strong> <em>ra</em>
[e]<strong>3</strong> <em>kifi</em>
[e]<strong>4</strong> <em>nuru</em>
[e]<strong>5</strong> <em>guhi</em>
[e]<strong>6</strong> <em>&rsquo;usi</em>
[e]<strong>7</strong> <em>salumi</em>

[5]Two-digit Numbers
Numbers between 1<overline>7</overline> and 16 are composed of the prefix <strong>sa</strong> and the final two syllables of the number, except for:
[f]<strong>sabilla</strong> (not <strong>sabila</strong>) 1<overline>3</overline>
[e]<strong>salura</strong> (not <strong>sara</strong>) 12
All other two digit numbers, except for 22, are formed by juxtaposing the tens digit with the units.
[f]<strong>mullukifi</strong> <overline>1</overline>3
[e]<strong>xitasalumi</strong> 17
[e]<strong>ranuru</strong> 24
[e]<strong>kifilaffi</strong> 3<overline>5</overline>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;usiqikka</strong> 60
The word for 22, the exception, is <strong>ranira</strong>.
[5]Three- and Four-digit Numbers
Three- and four-digit numbers are divided into the number of hundreds, and the remainder. This remainder is always the last two digits of the number.
The word for 100 is <strong>takki</strong>.
Other three-digit numbers beginning with a 1 are formed by prefixing <strong>takki</strong> to the remainder.
[f]<strong>takkinurukirallu</strong> 14<overline>2</overline>
Three- and four-digit numbers greater than this are formed by appending <strong>takki</strong> to the number of hundreds, which is then followed by the remainder as a separate word. 
[f]<strong>guhitakki &rsquo;usibila</strong> 56<overline>3</overline>
[e]<strong>saqikkatakki kifinuru</strong> 1034
[e]<strong>kiralluratakki missumullu</strong> <overline>2</overline>2<overline>4</overline><overline>1</overline>
In any of these cases, if the remainder is zero, it is left off.
[f]<strong>mullutakki</strong> <overline>1</overline>00
[e]<strong>ratakki</strong> 200
[e]<strong>saguhitakki</strong> 1500
[e]<strong>bilasalumitakki</strong> <overline>3</overline>700
[5]Higher and Lower Order Numbers
When a number is written out in digits, each set of four digits from the fractional point makes up a group. The group furthest from the fractional point may not have this full quota of digits. An <strong>index marker</strong> notes the identity of a particular group.
The index marker is composed of the prefix <strong>pa</strong> followed by the number of groups between this one and the fractional point. Positive index numbers are for the integer part of the number, and negative index numbers are for the mantissa.
The index marker is suffixed to the group word.
[f]<strong>paxita</strong> 1,0000
[e]<strong>para</strong> 1,0000,0000
[e]<strong>pakifi</strong> 1,0000,0000,0000
[e]<strong>pamullu</strong> 0.0001
[e]<strong>samissupaxita</strong> 1<overline>4</overline>,0000
[e]<strong>takkiranirapaxita</strong> 122,0000
[e]<strong>&rsquo;usitakki mullurapaxita</strong> 6<overline>1</overline>2,0000
There is nothing preventing an index-marked number being used within another index marker, although the second <strong>pa</strong> is usually geminated.
[f]<strong>pappaxita</strong> 1,0000<sup>1,0000</sup>
[e]<strong>papappaxita</strong> 1,0000<sup>1,0000^1,0000</sup>
[5]Non-integral Numbers
[6]Reading Mantissas
There are two ways to read a mantissa.
One uses the above method of index markers, and the second reads out the digits in pairs or individually. These methods are often combined: using index markers for the first digit groups, and then continuing to read digits separately.
[6]Repeating and Reflecting Strings
All rational numbers end with a repeating string of digits. For some numbers, this string is &ldquo;0&rdquo;. In non-zero cases, the word <strong>tuni</strong> repeat is inserted before the repeating string. The string must be read out with individual digits.
There are also numbers for which the repeating string can be cut in half, with digits in the second half being the negative of the digits in the first half. For these, only the first half is read out, with the word <strong>mala</strong> reflect inserted.
[f]<strong>tuni guhira</strong> 0.5252&hellip;
[e]<strong>paqikka xita tuni guhira</strong> 0.15252&hellip;
[e]<strong>paqikka xita mala guhira</strong> 0.152<overline>5</overline><overline>2</overline>52<overline>5</overline><overline>2</overline>&hellip;
[6]Fractions
The suffix <strong>ki</strong> separates the numerator from the denominator. <strong>Saki</strong> is used if the numerator is 1. There is also a commonly used variant for &frac12;: <strong>&rsquo;ima</strong>. 
[f]<strong>&rsquo;ima / saki ra</strong> &frac12;
[e]<strong>saki kifi</strong> &frac13;
[e]<strong>kifiki nuru</strong> &frac34;
[4]Ordinal Numbers
<strong>Ordinal</strong> numbers are used to mark position in a line or a list.
The first two ordinal numbers are suppletive, that is, they are not related to their cardinals. All other ordinals are formed by adding the suffix -<strong>uju</strong> <small-caps>ord</small-caps> to the cardinal number.
[f]<strong>bijaju</strong> <em>first</em>
[e]<strong>matta</strong> <em>second</em>
[e]<strong>kifuju</strong> <em>third</em>
[e]<strong>nuruju</strong> <em>fourth</em>
[e]<strong>salumuju</strong> <em>seventh</em>
[e]<strong>saqikkuju</strong> <em>fifteenth</em>
[e]<strong>saxituju</strong> <em>sixteenth</em>
[e]<strong>takkuju</strong> <em>two hundred and twenty-fifth</em>
[4]Using Numbers
Ordinal and cardinal numbers are used in noun phrases, and are inserted between any case markers or adpositions, and the noun.
[f]<strong>nuruju kimilli</strong>
[e]<em>four-</em><small-caps>ord</small-caps> <em>king</em>
[e]&ldquo;the fourth king.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>kalusalumi lulani</strong>
[e]<small-caps>abl</small-caps><em>-seven queen</em>
[e]&ldquo;due to the seven queens.&rdquo;
Numbers can be suffixed to a noun to denote not the quantity, but a quality.
[f]<strong>salumi &rsquo;isinnadi</strong>
[e]seven say-story-<small-caps>nom</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;seven books&rdquo;
[f]<strong>sinnasalumi</strong>
[e]<em>story-</em>seven
[e]&ldquo;septet&rdquo;
The number <strong>ra</strong> <em>two</em> can be used in this way to refer to a pair of something that is usually found in pairs
[f]<strong>luffura</strong> <em>eyes</em>
[e]<strong>&rsquo;itakkura</strong> <em>breasts</em>
[e]<strong>tibara</strong> <em>legs</em>
[3]Colours
The basis colour terms are all verbs:
[f]<strong>baju</strong> <em>blue</em>
[e]<strong>sa</strong> <em>yellow</em>
[e]<strong>miku</strong> <em>red</em>
[f]<strong>millu</strong> <em>brown</em>
[f]<strong>ki&#x294;a</strong> <em>white</em>
[e]<strong>ga</strong> <em>black</em>
<img src="../../../images/colourwheel.png">
<strong>Baju</strong> <em>blue</em> covers both light and dark blue, the darkest violets, and all but the lightest shades of green. <strong>Sa</strong> <em>yellow</em> covers the lightest shades of orange and green, as well as standard yellow. <strong>Miku</strong> <em>red</em> refers to all of red and pink, light purples and most of the orange spectrum, however, dark orange is subsumed under <strong>millu</strong> <em>brown</em>.
The figure above shows which shades are referred to by which term. <strong>Ki&#x294;a</strong> <em>white</em> is used to refer to very light greys, as well as the usual white. <strong>Ga</strong> <em>black</em> is used to refer to the darker greys, tending towards the black.
In continuous aspects, these denote the colour of an object. With discrete aspects, these refer to a change in colour.
[f]<strong>Pu&rsquo;iba ru miku</strong>.
[e]<em>ball</em> <small-caps>prs;gno</small-caps> <em>red</em>.
[e]&ldquo;The ball is red.&rdquo;
[f]<strong>&#x294;aradisi cani miku</strong>.
[e]<em>face</em>-<small-caps>3ani;gen prs;dyn</small-caps> <em>red</em>.
[e]&ldquo;She blushed.&rdquo;
Each of these terms can be compounded to refer to specific hues.
[f]<strong>mikumulu</strong> <em>blood red</em>
[e]<strong>bajukunubi</strong> <em>sky blue</em>
[e]<strong>ki&#x294;amasi</strong> <em>snow white</em>
[3]Kinship
[4]Marriage
<strong>Ju&rsquo;idukuru</strong> <em>marriage</em> is the life-bonding of two people. It is intended to be eternal, but can be broken if requested by either partner. It is not an exclusive arrangement, and one can be involved in concurrent marriages.
A bonded female is called a <strong>julliga</strong> <em>married woman</em>, and the male equivalent is a <strong>xalli</strong> <em>married man</em>. These terms are not used with possessives. On the other hand, the words <strong>kitisu</strong> <em>wife</em> and <strong>silu</strong> <em>husband</em> are used with possessives.
[4]Nuclear Family
The words <strong>sabba</strong> <em>father</em> and <strong>piha</strong> <em>mother</em> usually refer to biological parents, but can be applied to the main guardians if the biological parents are not around. These are used both with and without possessives.
There are two terms for children: <strong>tu</strong> <em>offspring</em> for postnatal children, <strong>&rsquo;appu</strong> <em>foetus</em> for antenatal. Both of these are gender-neutral, and are most often used with possessives.
There can be a suffixed <strong>ju&rsquo;i</strong> <em>link</em> for spouses&rsquo; offspring and parents&rsquo; spouses.
[f]<strong>sabbaju&rsquo;ipagu</strong>
[e]father-link-1<small-caps>gen</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;my step-father&rdquo;
[f]<strong>tuju&rsquo;iba</strong>
[e]offspring-link-2<small-caps>gen</small-caps>
[e]&ldquo;your step-daughter&rdquo;
Other kinship terms began as nuclear family names, but were thence extended across a generation. So <strong>kaqqa</strong> <em>brother</em> and <strong>kica</strong> <em>sister</em> can also be applied to cousins.
