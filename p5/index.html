    <h1>About the Asteroid Belt</h1>
    <p>This is a simulation of something like the &ldquo;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">Asteroid Belt</a>&rdquo; in <em>Star Wars</em>, written in a javascript library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5</a>.</p>
    <p>It consists of a random number of bodies under the mutual effect of a random gravity. Mass is proportional to radius, because I can&rsquo;t think of a good way to make density obvious. The barycentre of the system is always centred on the screen. Each body feels gravity <img src="newtonlaw.png" height="40" width="80"> from every other, unless they're eclipsing. This last condition is to prevent infinite speeds as the distance between a pair approaches zero.</p>
    <p>Click on the image to check it out: It looks best in full screen, and click on the system to get a new system.</p>
