    <h1>About the Asteroid Belt</h1>
    <p>This is a simulation of something like the &ldquo;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">Asteroid Belt</a>&rdquo; in <em>Star Wars</em>, written in a javascript library called <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5</a>.</p>
    <p>It consists of a random number of bodies with a random gravity. The barycentre of the system is always centred on the screen. Two bodies that eclipse each other do not affect each other - this is to prevent infinite speeds as the distance between them approaches zero, in accordance with the inverse square law.</p>
